# soju IRC extensions

This directory documents various soju-specific IRC extensions. All of the
extensions are under the vendored `soju.im` namespace.

Introducing a vendored extension is a good way to experiment with new ideas and
do some field testing. If a vendored extension is successful, please open a pull
request on the [IRCv3 specifications] repository for standardization.
